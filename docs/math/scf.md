# Self-consistent field method

The self-consistent field (SCF) method is a method to solve the Kohn-Sham equation. The SCF method is an iterative method. 

The SCF method starts from an initial guess of the wavefunction $\psi$, constructs the effective potential $v_{\text{eff}}$, and solves the Kohn-Sham equation to obtain the new wavefunction $\psi'$. The SCF method then uses $\psi'$ as the new initial guess and repeats the process until the wavefunction converges.
