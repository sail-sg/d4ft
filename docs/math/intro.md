Introduction to Quantum Chemistry
============

The target audience for this tutorial is curious machine learning / AI enthusiasts who are interested in learning 
more about AI for Science, in particular, quantum chemistry and how AI can be used to speed up and optimize 
calculations in this field.

Quantum chemistry is the study of the behavior and properties of atoms and molecules using quantum mechanics.
It is a crucial field of study in the realm of chemistry, as it helps us understand the behavior and interactions 
of atoms and molecules at a deeper level, for example, the protein folding.

In quantum mechanics, the behavior of particles is described using wave functions $\boldsymbol{\Psi}$. These wave functions 
describe the probability of finding a particle at a particular location in space.

The wave function of a system is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which is a mathematical equation that 
describes how the wave function changes over time.The solution to the Schrödinger equation gives us the energy levels and 
the form of the wave functions of the system.

One important method in quantum chemistry is density functional theory (DFT), which allows us to calculate the electronic
structure of a system using density functions. This is particularly useful for larger systems, such as proteins or materials, 
which cannot be accurately studied using traditional methods due to their complexity.

So, what exactly is DFT and how does it work? We will go into more detail in the next part, but for now, let's put it this way:
DFT states that the electron density of a system uniquely determines its energy. This allows us to calculate the energy of a 
system using its electron density, rather than the wave function of its electrons, which is much more difficult to calculate.

But how does AI fit into all of this? Well, the calculations involved in DFT can be extremely time-consuming for large system, 
even with the use of supercomputers. This is where machine learning and AI come in. By using deep learning algorithms, we can 
speed up these calculations and make them more efficient. This not only saves time, but also allows us to study even larger 
and more complex systems with more accuracy.

DFT has proven to be a powerful tool in quantum chemistry, allowing us to study complex systems with high accuracy. 
And with the help of AI, we can further optimize and speed up these calculations, making it an even more valuable tool in the field.

In the next part, we will go into more detail on the core concepts of quantum chemistry and DFT, and how the development of deep learning
algorithms has helped to speed up and optimize these calculations.
