Introduction to Quantum Chemistry
============


Quantum chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses quantum mechanical principles to study the behavior of atoms, molecules, and materials. It is based on the idea that the behavior of matter can be described using the principles of quantum mechanics, which is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic scales. Quantum chemistry uses mathematical models and computational techniques to study the electronic structure and properties of molecules, as well as chemical reactions and chemical dynamics. It can be used to understand and predict a wide range of chemical phenomena, including the behavior of atoms and molecules in the gas phase, the properties of solids, the reactivity of chemical compounds, and the nature of chemical bonds. It has also found applications in other areas of science and technology, such as electronics, energy production, and environmental science, and material science.
